# hs-predictor
A simple project for predicting an opponent's deck in Hearthstone.  
Python Version 3.6.5

hsdeckpredictor.py is a script for predicting the most likely deck as a whole (i.e. an entire decklist, 
with the probability that that is the complete deck in use)  

hscardsindeckpredictor.py is a script that, given the cards played, produces a list of the probabilities
that other cards are included in their deck.  

# Credit
